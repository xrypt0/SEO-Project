# SEO-Project
A simple benchmarking SEO tool written in Python. The program extracts and compares the values of the sites you enter for you (the data is pulled from Google PageSpeed Insights when comparing). It saves the results in a TXT file and presents you with the expressions greater (>) and less than (<) which site is better or not.

# What Is The SEO ?

SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, it means the process of improving your site to increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to your business in Google, Bing, and other search engines.

Thanks to SEO, companies can profit more from their online transactions and disqualify rival companies against them.

# How To Use ?

1-) First of all, Google Chrome must be installed on your computer.

2-) Install the Selenium library by typing ```pip3 install selenium``` on your terminal screen.

3-) Create a file named `report.txt` to the location where the program is installed.

4-) You can now compare your websites! The results will be saved in the file named 'report.txt' in the location where the program is installed.
